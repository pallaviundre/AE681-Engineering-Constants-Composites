# Engineering Constants Analysis of Unidirectional Composites

**Course:** AE681, IIT Kanpur  
**Instructor:** Prof. P. M. Mohite  
**Duration:** Jan 2025 – Mar 2025  

## Objective
Determine engineering constants (E1, E2, G12, ν12) for unidirectional fiber-reinforced composites over varying fiber volume fractions (Vf) using multiple analytical methods, and compare predictions in unified plots.

## Approach
- Collected given fiber and matrix properties from the course dataset.
- Applied Strength of Materials, Voigt upper bound, Reuss lower bound, Hill’s average, and Concentric Cylinder Assemblage (CCA) methods.
- Generated comparative plots for each constant with all methods in a single figure.
- Analyzed variations and discussed reasons for agreements or deviations.

## Results
- Produced comparative graphs showing close agreement at extreme Vf values and noticeable divergence in intermediate ranges.
- Gained insights into micromechanical bounds and their implications for composite design.
